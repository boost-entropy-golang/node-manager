> [!IMPORTANT]
> The code has moved to [firehose-core](https://github.com/streamingfast/firehose-core/tree/develop/node-manager), this repository still exists in read-only form so that older dependencies still resolves correctly.

This service is a wrapping process that operates blockchain nodes as part of **[StreamingFast](https://github.com/streamingfast/streamingfast)**.

## Installation

Build and run from here:
* [**EOSIO on StreamingFast**](https://github.com/streamingfast/sf-eosio)
* [**Ethereum on StreamingFast**](https://github.com/streamingfast/sf-ethereum)

## Overview

1) Operator (process commands, owns the superviser, owns the http handlers that sends the commands to him)

2) Superviser is the the one managing the actual blockchain software (nodeos, geth..). It is made of an embedded generic superviser struct, plus specific nodeos/geth embedding it. It owns the plugins.

## Shutdown pattern for Node-Manager only:
App creates:
* Superviser
* Operator (+superviser)

So, the ownership is `app -> operator -> superviser`
* app.OnTerminating(operator.Shutdown())
* operator.OnTerminating(sendCmd:"maintenance", superviser.Shutdown())
* superviser.OnTerminating(superviser.Stop() (blocking))

## Shutdown pattern for Mindreader:

App creates:
* Superviser
* Operator (+superviser)
* mindreaderPlugin (has call back to set maintenance on operator and stopBlockReached)

App sets:
* superviser.RegisterLogPlugin(mindreaderPlugin)

So, the ownership is `app -> operator -> superviser -> mindreader`
* app.OnTerminating(operator.Shutdown())
* operator.OnTerminating(sendCmd:"maintenance", superviser.Shutdown())
* superviser.OnTerminating(mindreader.Shutdown(), then endLogPlugins)
* superviser.OnTerminated(endLogPlugins)
* mindreader.OnTerminating(async operator.Shutdown(), wait consumeFlowDone)
    * mindreader::archiver closes consumeFlowDone when superviser.endLogPlugins(+upload completed)
    * mindreader shuts itself down when stopBlockNum reached
* mindreader.OnTerminated -> app.Shutdown()
